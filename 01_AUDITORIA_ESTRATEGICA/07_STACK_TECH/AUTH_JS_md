Getting Started
Introduction
What is Auth.js?
Auth.js is a runtime agnostic library based on standard Web APIs that integrates deeply with multiple modern JavaScript frameworks to provide an authentication experience that’s simple to get started with, easy to extend, and always private and secure!

This documentation covers next-auth@5.0.0-beta and later and all other frameworks under the @auth/* namespace. Documentation for next-auth@4.x.y can still be found at next-auth.js.org.

Select your framework of choice to get started, or view the example application deployment or repository with the buttons below.
